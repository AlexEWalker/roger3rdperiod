    <h1>Drylands</h1>
    <p>"You play as a drop of water on the verge of evaporation. Your only hope is to find "The Great Oasis" on the very edge of the dry landscape.</p>
    <p>The wasteland is crawling with giants known as "The Ashy" who made the once great land into a desert in the first place.</p>
    <p>You must avoid them at all cost! If one were to touch you, you'd evaporate instantly.</p>
